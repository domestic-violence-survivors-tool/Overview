# Domestic-Violence-Survivors-Tool

The following project relates to the process known as Build Weeks at Lambda School. Students building apps together in teams to demonstrate your mastery over the material you have thus far learned at Lambda School, preparing you to enter the job force one project at a time.

## Build Week Mission and Objectives
The Objectives for an effective build week are:

- Allow each student to demonstrate their proficiency across the objectives learned over the last Unit at Lambda School.
- Prepare each student in their respective section to develop a firm understanding of how Lambda Labs operates.
- Provide students with as many opportunities as possible to learn what it's like to develop software in a real world environment.
- Provide students time to develop at least 5 projects worthy of professional portfolio during their time at Lambda School.
- Encourage cross section and cross course collaboration amongst our student body.

## Project Overview

Financial insecurity is the No. 1 reason survivors of domestic violence remain in or return to abuse. In order to break the cycle of violence, we must remove obstacles to financial security for survivors. To that end, [FreeFrom](https://www.freefrom.org/) is developing an interactive calculator for their website. It will serve survivors to enable them to better understand the costs of leaving and staying safe. The calculator will include prompts to help users understand and identify the relevant costs. This project will not only help survivors and raise awareness of the costs of domestic violence, but will also capture valuable data that will help FreeForm drive positive policy change!

## MVP Feature Breakdown:

### Onboarding
- A domestic violence survivor can come to the page and insert their data into the online calculator.
- There will be two sections of the calculator:
  1. A monthly personal budget, and 
  2. The costs of relocating
- The monthly personal budget will allow user to enter their ongoing unavoidable costs they might have while trying to relocate. The fields include;
  1. Transportation,
  2. Food,
  3. Health Insurance, 
  4. car insurance,
  5. car loans, 
  6. personal loans, and 
  7. other expenses
- The relocation costs include: 
  - nightly hotel costs while in transit (if applicable), 
  - new rental deposit, 
  - utility connection fees, 
  - storage unit, 
  - new monthly rent (if they already know this number), 
  - car rental and gas (if don't own a car), 
  - cell phone disconnection/connect fee (if they have to get a new number), 
  - moving truck rental, 
  - gas for moving truck, 
  - storage unit if unable to take their things with them,
  - mental health treatment, 
  - income loss (what they are loosing by leaving their current job), 
  - cost of any additional security measures they must take
- After they have entered these fields, a page will show up combining their total monthly expenses plus the monthly cost of relocation.

## Deployment:
Recommend to deploy your server to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs), and your front end to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/). Both services provide free tiers and easy to use interfaces. 

It is recommended that you keep your front end and backend codebases in separate GitHub repositories.
